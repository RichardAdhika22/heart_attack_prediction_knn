<h3 align="center">Heart Attack Prediction with KNN</h3>

## üßê About 

In this project, we are trying to predict whether or not someone has a high risk of getting a heart attack. We will analyze a dataset with various factors that may influence the risk of getting a heart attack. The data for Hungarian heart attacks is imported from the UCI machine learning repository and written in.csv format, with 294 rows and 14 columns. The variable num is what we are trying to predict. The values of the num column are either 1 (high risk) or 0 (low risk). We are going to use the KNN-classification algorithm to build the classification model.

Our primary research question is: How well can we predict whether someone has a high or low risk of getting a heart attack? Or, in other words, what is the accuracy of our classification model based on evaluating it on the testing set? We will consider accuracy above 75% as a good classification model.
